# mtg-deck-format-checker
Confront Cockatrice decks with banlists, a python file to run (basic GUI)

WARNING
This program is still for personal use, there are hard-copy paths from my computer, and some personal ways of naming/putting files.
I will work on a shareable version later (and why not integrate it to Cockatrice !?)

PREREQUISITE
Be able to call "python" from a terminal (needs to download a python shell/eventually put in in the bash(?))

Launch it :
- Open a terminal (Windows : Windows + "cmd" / Mac : LaunchPad > "Terminal" / Linux : you know how...)
- Go to the folder where you downloaded these files (```cd [...]```)
- Launch the program with ```python cockatrice_dico_comp.py```
- Done ! A pop-up opens, and browse to select your deck to compare
